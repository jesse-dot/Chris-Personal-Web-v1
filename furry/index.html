<h1>Explaining the Furry Fandom</h1>

<p>The furry fandom is a community made of people who have an interest in anthropomorphic animals, which are animals that have been given human characteristics such as the ability to talk, walk upright, and use tools.

Furries often create and share art, stories, comics, and other forms of media that feature anthropomorphic animals. Many furries also create or commission artwork of their own anthropomorphic "fursona" which is an anthropomorphic animal that represents them.

Furries often meet up at conventions and other social events where they can cosplay as their fursona or otherwise participate in the community.

The furry fandom is often associated with a strong online presence, with many furries communicating through social media and participating in online furry-focused communities.</p>
